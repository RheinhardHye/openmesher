Make modules more modular
Support one-off configs for routers (module)
Move config options to a .rc file or args
Ability to specify a node as server-only or client-only (useful when you have a main office, or when one router is behind NAT)
Customizable modules for each router (the corp router has a special ripd.conf, don't overwrite it, etc...)
